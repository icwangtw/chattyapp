Chatty
=====================

Chatty is an online chatroom application built with React, Webpack and WebSockets where user can send messages and image links. 

Users can communicate with each other anonymously without having to register accounts, or enter a display name to identify themselves. The app displays the number of users currently online and notifies when a user updates its display name.
